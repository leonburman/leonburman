Welcome to my humble GitHub profile! Make yourself comfortable. <br/>
I'm a web/software developer based in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex (UK). I have over 10 years of working experience in the industry, and my most recent endeavour is building my small business, [PixelsMatter](https://pixelsmatter.io), with my fiancÃ© and Co-Founder/Designer, Christine. 

My favourite stacks are:
- JAMstack (JavaScript API Markup), typically utilising Next/React, TypeScript, Tailwind and a Node-based CMS
- PHP, Laravel/WordPress, MySQL and Docker
- Plain ole HTML5, CSS3 and ES6 JavaScript
